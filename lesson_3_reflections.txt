When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So you can have a copy of your work safely stored and backed up in the cloud.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Other people could be making changes to the remote repo and you may not be ready to absorb
them yet.  Manually pulling allows you to decide when you want to integrate with another
branch.
