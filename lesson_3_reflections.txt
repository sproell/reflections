When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So you can have a copy of your work safely stored and backed up in the cloud.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Other people could be making changes to the remote repo and you may not be ready to absorb
them yet.  Manually pulling allows you to decide when you want to integrate with another
branch.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

Forks create a copy within github of another repository on github.  The forked repository
references the original repository and maintains its commit history.  Clones are also copies of 
repositories, but they have parent/child relationships.  Changes to cloned repositories can be
pushed into the parent whereas changes to forked repos cannot be pushed into the original repo.
Branches are new commit streams within a single repository.  They allow work to progress within
the repo without affecting the master branch.
